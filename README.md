# <Book search engine>

## Description

In this project, I refactored the code of a book search engine to be a GraphQL API built with the Apollo server, using the MERN stack. I started off with a completed end product, and updated the code. I was able to learn a lot more about GraphQL and the Apollo server with this project, between setting up typeDefs,resolvers, mutations, and more. I also got more experience dealing with authentication for sign ups and logins.

## Installation

To install, run

```
npm run install
```

## Usage

To use this book search engine locally, after installing, you must run

```
npm run build
```

followed by

```
npm run develop
```

OR, you can visit the deployed link
[Google Book Search](https://powerful-bastion-19773.herokuapp.com/)

Once running, the user can then search books using the search bar to find titles, descriptions, and authors of books relating to the topic searched.
If the user chooses to sign up, they are able to save books to their profile, and view their saved books, as well as delete them.
